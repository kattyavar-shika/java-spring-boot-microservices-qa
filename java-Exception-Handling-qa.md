## What is an Exception in Java?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts its normal flow.
- Exceptions are objects representing runtime errors, such as NullPointerException, ArithmeticException, or
  FileNotFoundException.

</details>

## What are the types of Exceptions in Java?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- There are two main types of exceptions in Java:
    - Checked Exceptions: Exceptions checked at compile time, e.g., IOException, SQLException.
    - Unchecked Exceptions: Exceptions not checked at compile time, e.g., NullPointerException, ArithmeticException.

</details>

## What is the difference between throw and throws?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **throw:** Used to explicitly throw an exception.
    - Example: throw new IOException("File not found");
- **throws:** Declares exceptions that a method can throw.
    - Example: public void readFile() throws IOException.

</details>

## Explain the control flow of try-catch-finally blocks in Java.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **try block:** Code that might throw an exception is written here.
- **catch block:** This block catches exceptions of specified types.
- **finally block:** This block always executes, whether an exception occurs or not, except in cases like System.exit().

- **Control Flow:**
    - If no exception occurs: try → finally (skip catch).
    - If an exception occurs: try → catch (handling block) → finally.

</details>

## What happens if an exception is thrown in the catch block?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- If an exception occurs in the catch block and is not handled there, the control will search for another enclosing
  catch block or propagate the exception to the calling method.

</details>

## Can we have multiple catch blocks? If yes, how is the control flow managed?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Yes, multiple catch blocks are allowed. The control flow is determined by the type of exception:
    - The first catch block with a matching exception type will execute.
    - If none of the catch blocks match, the exception propagates to the calling method.

</details>

## What happens if there is a return statement in try or catch? Does finally execute?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Yes, the finally block always executes, even if the try or catch block has a return statement.
- However, the value returned is determined by the try or catch block, as the execution order is:

- try → finally → Return Value.

</details>

## What is the difference between Error and Exception?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **Error:** Indicates serious problems that an application should not try to handle, e.g., OutOfMemoryError,
  StackOverflowError.
- **Exception:** Indicates conditions that an application can handle, e.g., IOException, ArithmeticException.

</details>

## Can we write try without a catch block?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Yes, but it must have a finally block. For example:

```java
try {
    System.out.println("Trying something risky");
} finally {
    System.out.println("Cleaning up resources");
}
```

</details>

## What is a finally block and when is it executed?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- A finally block contains code that is always executed after try and catch, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is typically used for resource cleanup.

</details>

## What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **final:** A keyword used for constants, preventing inheritance, or method overriding.
- **finally:** A block used in exception handling for cleanup.
- **finalize():** A method called by the Garbage Collector before an object is destroyed.
  - Note:
    - The finalize() method in Java has been deprecated starting from Java 9, and it has been removed entirely in Java 18.
    - If you’re using Java 11 or a later version, you should avoid using finalize() and adopt modern alternatives like Cleaner or try-with-resources for resource management.

</details>

##  Can we throw multiple exceptions from a method?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Yes, a method can throw multiple exceptions using the throws keyword, separated by commas:

```java
public void process() throws IOException, SQLException {
    // Code
}

```

</details>

## What happens if an exception is thrown in the finally block?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- If an exception is thrown in the finally block, it overrides any exception thrown in the try or catch blocks. 
- This can lead to loss of the original exception.

</details>

## What is the control flow if an exception is thrown but not caught in a method?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- If an exception is thrown and not caught, it propagates up the call stack to the calling method. 
- If no method in the stack handles it, the program terminates with an uncaught exception.

</details>

## Write a code snippet to demonstrate the order of execution for try, catch, and finally.
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```java
public class TestException {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside try");
            int result = 10 / 0;
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Inside catch: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Inside finally");
        }
    }
}

```
- Output

```cmd
Inside try  
Inside catch: / by zero  
Inside finally

```

</details>


## What is try-with-resources in Java?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- he try-with-resources statement in Java is a feature introduced in Java 7 that allows you to declare resources to be used within a try block. 
- Resources declared this way are automatically closed at the end of the block, ensuring proper resource management and avoiding resource leaks. 
- A resource must implement the AutoCloseable interface or its subtype, Closeable.

```java
try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
    System.out.println(br.readLine());
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

```

- Here, the BufferedReader is automatically closed after the try block.

</details>

## What are the benefits of using try-with-resources?
## Why should developers use try-with-resources instead of traditional try-catch-finally blocks?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- The benefits of try-with-resources include:
  - **Automatic Resource Management:** Resources are automatically closed, reducing the risk of resource leaks.
  - **Cleaner Code:** No need to explicitly close resources in a finally block.
  - **Better Exception Handling:** Proper handling of exceptions during resource closing, avoiding suppressed exceptions that can occur with traditional finally.
  - **Readability:** Code is shorter and easier to understand.

</details>


## Which interfaces should a resource implement to be used in a try-with-resources statement?
## What conditions must a resource satisfy to work with try-with-resources?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- A resource must implement the AutoCloseable interface (introduced in Java 7) or its subtype Closeable. 
- Both define the close() method, which is automatically invoked at the end of the try block.
- **AutoCloseable** is more general and can be used with any resource.
- **Closeable** is specific to java.io and deals primarily with I/O streams.

</details>

## How does exception handling work in try-with-resources?
## If an exception occurs in both the try block and while closing the resource, which one is propagated?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- If an exception occurs both in the try block and when closing the resource, the exception from the try block is propagated, and the exception from the resource's close() method is suppressed. 
- The suppressed exceptions can be accessed using the getSuppressed() method on the primary exception.

- Example
```java
try (MyResource resource = new MyResource()) {
    throw new Exception("Exception in try block");
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Caught: " + e.getMessage());
    for (Throwable suppressed : e.getSuppressed()) {
        System.out.println("Suppressed: " + suppressed);
    }
}

```
</details>

## Can we declare multiple resources in a try-with-resources statement?
## Is it possible to manage multiple resources in a single try-with-resources statement?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Yes, multiple resources can be declared in a single try-with-resources statement by separating them with a semicolon (;).

- Example
```java
try (
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("output.txt"))
) {
    pw.println(br.readLine());
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

```
- Each resource will be closed in the reverse order of their declaration.

</details>

##  Is it mandatory to declare resources within the parentheses of a try-with-resources statement?
## Can resources be declared outside the try-with-resources parentheses?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- No, for a resource to be automatically closed, it must be declared within the parentheses of the try-with-resources statement. 
- However, you can pass pre-existing resources to the block, but you will need to manage their closure manually.

- Example 
```java
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
try (br) {
    System.out.println(br.readLine());
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
// br.close() is called automatically in this case (Java 9+)

```

- Starting from Java 9, an already declared resource can be used in a try-with-resources statement, provided it is final or effectively final.

</details>


## What happens if a null resource is used in a try-with-resources statement?
## if a resource is null, will the try-with-resources block throw a NullPointerException?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- No, the try-with-resources block will not throw a NullPointerException if a resource is null. 
- The close() method is not invoked on null resources.

</details>

## Can we use custom resources in a try-with-resources statement?
## How can you create a custom resource to be used with try-with-resources?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- To use a custom resource in a try-with-resources statement, the class must implement the AutoCloseable or Closeable interface and override the close() method.

- Example 
```java 
class MyResource implements AutoCloseable {
    @Override
    public void close() {
        System.out.println("Resource closed");
    }
}

try (MyResource resource = new MyResource()) {
    System.out.println("Using resource");
}

```

- Output 
```cmd
Using resource
Resource closed

```
</details>

##  How is try-with-resources different from a traditional finally block?
## How does try-with-resources improve upon using a finally block?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- try-with-resources automatically closes resources and handles exceptions during resource closing, which simplifies code and reduces the chance of errors. 
- In a traditional finally block, developers must explicitly close resources, 
- which can lead to errors like:
  - Forgetting to close the resource.
  - Suppressed exceptions not being handled properly.
  - Verbose and harder-to-read code.

</details>


## Can try-with-resources be nested?
## Is it possible to nest try-with-resources statements?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Yes, try-with-resources statements can be nested like traditional try blocks.

- Example 
```java
try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file1.txt"))) {
    try (BufferedReader br2 = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file2.txt"))) {
        System.out.println(br.readLine() + br2.readLine());
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

```
</details>

## In a try-with-resources statement with multiple resources, in what order are the resources closed? Why is this order important?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Resources in a try-with-resources statement are closed in the reverse order of their declaration.
- This order is important because it ensures that resources that depend on others are closed properly. 
- For instance:
```java
try (
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("output.txt"))
) {
    pw.println(br.readLine());
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

```

- A PrintWriter might need to flush data that was read using a BufferedReader.
- Closing the PrintWriter first ensures all operations are complete before closing the BufferedReader.

</details>

## Given the following code snippet:

```java
try (
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("output.txt"))
) {
    pw.println(br.readLine());
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
### 1 What happens to the resources br and pw when the try block ends?
### 2 What would be the impact if the resources were closed in the same order as they were declared?


<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- When the try block ends:
  - Both br (BufferedReader) and pw (PrintWriter) are automatically closed because they are declared in the try-with-resources block.
  - They are closed in the reverse order of their declaration
    - First, pw.close() is called to ensure all buffered data is written to the file.
    - Then, br.close() is called to release the file resource being read.
    
- Impact of closing in the same order as declaration:
  - If br.close() were called before pw.close(), it could lead to runtime issues
    - For example, if pw attempted to write more data that relied on br being open, it would fail because br is already closed.
  - Reverse closure ensures resources are released in a safe and logical sequence.
