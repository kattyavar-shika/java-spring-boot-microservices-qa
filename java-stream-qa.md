## What is the Stream API in Java?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- The Stream API, introduced in Java 8, allows functional-style operations on sequences of elements, such as collections. 
- It provides a high-level abstraction for processing data in a declarative way, utilizing lambda expressions. 
- Streams can be used for operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing data in a concise and parallelizable manner.

- A Stream is not a data structure itself; it takes data from a source (like a collection) and processes it in a sequence of operations.

- Key points about Streams:
  - Streams can be sequential or parallel.
  - Operations are lazy; computations are only triggered when a terminal operation is invoked.
  - Streams can be infinite (e.g., generating an infinite sequence of numbers).

## What are the differences between Collection and Stream in Java?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

| Feature        | Collection                                  | Stream                                     |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**    | Represents a data structure.               | Represents a sequence of elements to be processed. |
| **Storage**    | Stores elements.                           | Does not store elements; it only provides operations for processing data. |
| **Operations** | Performs operations like add, remove, etc.  | Performs operations like filter, map, reduce, etc. |
| **Iteration**  | It is eagerly evaluated.                    | It is lazily evaluated.                   |
| **Mutability** | Can modify the original collection.        | Cannot modify the original data source (immutable). |
| **Parallelism**| Cannot handle parallelism on its own.      | Can process data in parallel using `.parallelStream()`. |

## Explain the difference between intermediate and terminal operations in Stream API.
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **Intermediate operations:**
  - Return a new Stream.
  - They are lazy; no processing is done until a terminal operation is invoked.
  - Examples: filter(), map(), sorted(), etc.
- **Terminal operations:**
  - Trigger the processing of the Stream.
  - They produce a result or a side effect, and after a terminal operation, **the Stream cannot be reused.**
  - Examples: collect(), forEach(), reduce(), count(), anyMatch(), etc.

Example 

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
long count = numbers.stream()          // Stream created
    .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)           // Intermediate operation
    .count();                          // Terminal operation
System.out.println(count);             // Output: 2

```
</details>


## What is the difference between map() and flatMap() in Streams?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **map():**
  - Transforms each element in the Stream into another element. It returns a Stream of the transformed elements.
    ```java
    List<String> words = Arrays.asList("hello", "world");
    List<Integer> lengths = words.stream()
                                  .map(String::length)  // Applies the length function to each element
                                  .collect(Collectors.toList());
    System.out.println(lengths); // Output: [5, 5]
    
    ```
- **flatMap():**
  - Flattens a Stream of collections into a single Stream. It is used when you want to flatten nested collections (e.g., List of Lists).

    ```java
    List<List<String>> lists = Arrays.asList(
        Arrays.asList("a", "b"), 
        Arrays.asList("c", "d"));
    List<String> flatList = lists.stream()
                                 .flatMap(List::stream)  // Flattens the nested lists
                                 .collect(Collectors.toList());
    System.out.println(flatList); // Output: [a, b, c, d]
    
    ```

</details>

## What are the common Stream operations in Java?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **filter():**
  - Filters elements based on a condition.
    ```java
    List<Integer> evenNumbers = numbers.stream()
                                       .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                                       .collect(Collectors.toList());
    
    ```
- **Map():**
  - map(): Transforms elements using a function.

    ```java
    List<Integer> squaredNumbers = numbers.stream()
                                          .map(n -> n * n)
                                          .collect(Collectors.toList());
    
    ```
    
- **reduce():**
  - reduce(): Reduces the Stream to a single value.
    ```java
    int sum = numbers.stream()
                     .reduce(0, Integer::sum); // Sum of all elements
    
    ```

- **collect():**
  - collect(): Collects the elements into a collection (like a List, Set, etc.)
    ```java
    List<Integer> evenNumbers = numbers.stream()
                                       .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                                       .collect(Collectors.toList());
    
    ```

- **foreach():**
  - forEach(): Iterates over the elements of the Stream.

    ```java
    numbers.stream().forEach(System.out::println);
    
    ```

- **distinct():**
  - distinct(): Removes duplicate elements from the Stream.

    ```java
    List<Integer> distinctNumbers = numbers.stream()
                                           .distinct()
                                           .collect(Collectors.toList());
    
    ```
    
- **sorted():**
  - sorted(): Sorts elements in natural or custom order.

    ```java
    List<Integer> sortedNumbers = numbers.stream()
                                         .sorted()
                                         .collect(Collectors.toList());
    
    ```
    
- **limit():**
  - limit(): Limits the number of elements in the Stream.

    ```java
    List<Integer> limitedNumbers = numbers.stream()
                                          .limit(3)
                                          .collect(Collectors.toList());
    
    ```
</details>

## What is the difference between findFirst() and findAny()?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **findFirst():** Returns the first element of the Stream (if present). It is ordered and consistent in sequential and parallel streams.
- **findAny():** Returns any element from the Stream. It is typically used in parallel processing, as it may return different results based on the parallel execution.

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
Optional<Integer> first = numbers.stream().findFirst();  // Returns 1
Optional<Integer> any = numbers.stream().findAny();      // May return any element

```
</details>


## How does parallelStream() work in Java?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- The parallelStream() method allows you to process elements in parallel, leveraging multiple CPU cores for faster computation, particularly when dealing with large datasets.
- However, it is important to note that not all operations benefit from parallelism, and some operations (such as those that mutate shared state) can result in incorrect behavior or performance degradation.

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int sum = numbers.parallelStream()
                 .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)
                 .sum();  // Processes the Stream in parallel
System.out.println(sum);  // Output: 15

```

</details>

## What is the Optional class, and how is it used in Streams?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Optional is a container object which may or may not contain a value. It is used to avoid NullPointerException and to represent the absence of a value.
- In the context of Streams, methods like findFirst(), findAny(), and reduce() return Optional<T> because they may not find a result.

```java
Optional<Integer> firstEven = numbers.stream()
                                    .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                                    .findFirst();
firstEven.ifPresent(System.out::println);  // Prints the first even number if present

```
</details>


## What is a lazy evaluation in Streams?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Lazy evaluation in Streams means that intermediate operations (such as map(), filter()) are not executed until a terminal operation (such as collect(), forEach(), or reduce()) is invoked. This allows for more efficient processing and avoids unnecessary computations.
- For example, if you have a chain of operations and the final operation doesn't need some intermediate result, that intermediate step might not even be executed.

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int result = numbers.stream()
                    .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)  // Lazy
                    .map(n -> n * 2)          // Lazy
                    .reduce(0, Integer::sum); // Terminal
System.out.println(result);  // Output: 12

```

- In the example above, map() and filter() are lazy, and the operations only happen when the terminal reduce() operation is called.

</details>

## What are the advantages of using Stream API in Java?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Using the Stream API offers several advantages:
- Concise and Declarative Code:
  - You can perform complex data processing operations with just a few lines of code, improving readability and reducing boilerplate.

- Parallelism
  - The parallelStream() method makes it easy to process data in parallel, utilizing multiple CPU cores for improved performance, especially with large datasets.

- Lazy Evaluation:
  - Intermediate operations are lazy, meaning that computations are deferred until a terminal operation is executed. This allows for optimization, such as skipping unnecessary operations.

- Functional Style:
  - It promotes functional programming by using lambda expressions and higher-order functions, reducing the need for explicit iteration.

- Cleaner and More Readable:
  - It makes code more readable by abstracting away the need for explicit loops and mutable state.

</details>

## What does the Collectors.toList() method do?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- The Collectors.toList() is a predefined collector in the Collectors class that collects the elements of a Stream into a List. It is a terminal operation that returns a List containing all the elements of the Stream.
```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
List<Integer> evenNumbers = numbers.stream()
                                   .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                                   .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(evenNumbers);  // Output: [2, 4]

```

- Key Points:
  - The resulting list is not necessarily ordered unless the stream itself is ordered.
  - It is the most common collector when you want to accumulate elements into a collection.

</details>

## How can you create an infinite stream in Java?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- You can create infinite streams using methods like Stream.iterate() or Stream.generate().

- **Stream.iterate():**
  - Generates an infinite sequence of elements, where each element is derived from the previous one.

    ```java
    Stream<Integer> infiniteStream = Stream.iterate(0, n -> n + 2);  // Generates: 0, 2, 4, 6, ...
    infiniteStream.limit(10).forEach(System.out::println);  // Prints first 10 even numbers
    
    ```
- **Stream.generate():**
  - Generates an infinite stream based on a supplier function, where each element is independently generated.

```java
Stream<Double> infiniteStream = Stream.generate(Math::random);  // Generates random numbers
infiniteStream.limit(5).forEach(System.out::println);  // Prints 5 random numbers

```
</details>

##  What is Collectors.joining() and how is it used in Java Streams?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- The Collectors.joining() is a collector used to concatenate the elements of a Stream into a single String. You can optionally specify a delimiter, a prefix, and a suffix.

syntax : 

```java
Collectors.joining(CharSequence delimiter, CharSequence prefix, CharSequence suffix)

```

- Where 
  - Delimiter: A string that separates elements in the resulting string.
  - Prefix: A string to be added at the start.
  - Suffix: A string to be added at the end.

Example:

```java
List<String> words = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry");
String result = words.stream()
                     .collect(Collectors.joining(", ", "[", "]"));
System.out.println(result);  // Output: [apple, banana, cherry]

```

- If you don't specify a delimiter, Collectors.joining() simply joins the elements without separators.

</details>

## How can you use reduce() to compute the sum of a collection?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- The reduce() method in Java Streams is used to combine elements of a Stream into a single result. It takes a binary operator, which is applied to each element.

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int sum = numbers.stream()
                 .reduce(0, (a, b) -> a + b);  // Initial value is 0, binary operator adds each element
System.out.println(sum);  // Output: 15

```
- Here, 0 is the identity value, and (a, b) -> a + b is the accumulator function that adds each element to the accumulated value.

Note: If the stream is empty, the identity value is returned.

</details>


## What is the difference between peek() and forEach() in Streams?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **peek():**
  - The peek() method is an intermediate operation that allows you to examine elements of the Stream as they are being processed. It is typically used for debugging or logging purposes.
  - It does not consume the Stream, and you can chain other operations after it.

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
numbers.stream()
       .peek(n -> System.out.println("Processing: " + n))  // Debugging log
       .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
       .collect(Collectors.toList());

```

- **foreach():**
  - The forEach() method is a terminal operation that processes each element of the Stream. Once forEach() is invoked, the Stream is consumed and can no longer be used.
  - It is typically used for side-effects (like printing, updating external state, etc.).

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
numbers.stream()
       .forEach(n -> System.out.println("Processing: " + n));  // Consumes the Stream

```

</details>

## How do you handle NullPointerException in Streams?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

-  You can handle NullPointerException in Streams by using the Optional class, filtering out null elements, or using Objects::nonNull in your lambda expressions.
- using filter() to eliminate null values.

```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("apple", null, "banana");
list.stream()
    .filter(Objects::nonNull)  // Remove null elements
    .forEach(System.out::println);  // Output: apple, banana

```

- Using Optional to safely process null values:

```java
Optional<String> result = Optional.ofNullable("hello")
                                  .map(String::toUpperCase);
result.ifPresent(System.out::println);  // Output: HELLO

```

- By using Optional, you can safely handle the presence or absence of values and avoid NullPointerException.

</details>



## How would you use the flatMap() method to transform and flatten data in a Stream?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- The flatMap() method is useful when you have a collection of collections and want to "flatten" them into a single Stream. For example, if you have a List<List<Integer>> and you want to get a flat list of integers, you can use flatMap().

Example 
```java
List<List<Integer>> listOfLists = Arrays.asList(
    Arrays.asList(1, 2),
    Arrays.asList(3, 4),
    Arrays.asList(5, 6)
);

List<Integer> flatList = listOfLists.stream()
                                    .flatMap(List::stream)  // Flattens the lists
                                    .collect(Collectors.toList());

System.out.println(flatList);  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

```

- Here, List::stream converts each list into a Stream, and flatMap() flattens them into a single Stream.

</details>

## What happens if you use Stream operations after invoking a terminal operation?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Once a terminal operation is invoked on a Stream, the Stream is considered consumed and cannot be reused. 
- Any further operations on the Stream will throw an IllegalStateException.

Example 
```java
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3);
stream.forEach(System.out::println);  // Terminal operation

// The following line will throw an IllegalStateException
stream.forEach(System.out::println);  // Error: stream has already been consumed

```
</details>

## What is the difference between Stream.forEach() and Collectors.toList()?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **forEach():**
  - It is a terminal operation used to iterate over the elements of the Stream and perform an action on each element. It does not return a result (it's typically used for side effects).

Example 

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
numbers.stream().forEach(System.out::println);  // Prints each element, no collection returned

```

- **Collectors.toList():**
  - It is a terminal operation that collects the elements of a Stream into a List. Unlike forEach(), it produces a result (a List), which can be used for further processing.

Example 
```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
List<Integer> result = numbers.stream()
                              .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                              .collect(Collectors.toList());  // Collects into a List
System.out.println(result);  // Output: [2, 4]

```

</details>

## What is a Stream pipeline in Java?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- A Stream pipeline is a sequence of operations that can be applied to a Stream of elements. 
- A typical Stream pipeline consists of:
  - Source: The data source (e.g., a collection, array, or generator function).
  - Intermediate Operations: These operations transform the Stream (e.g., map(), filter(), sorted()).
  - Terminal Operations: These operations produce a result or side effect (e.g., collect(), reduce(), forEach()).

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
List<Integer> result = numbers.stream()                   // Source: numbers
                              .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)     // Intermediate operation
                              .map(n -> n * n)              // Intermediate operation
                              .collect(Collectors.toList()); // Terminal operation
System.out.println(result);  // Output: [4, 16]

```
</details>

## What is the difference between Stream and Iterator?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **Stream**
  - The Stream API is designed to allow functional-style operations on sequences of elements.
  - It can be parallelized easily, and its operations are lazy (only evaluated when a terminal operation is invoked).
  - A Stream can only be traversed once.
  - Streams support higher-order functions like map(), filter(), reduce(), etc.
- **Iterator**
  - An Iterator is an object used to iterate over collections in Java (e.g., ArrayList, HashSet).
  - It is imperative and does not provide built-in functional operations.
  - You can iterate over a collection using an Iterator multiple times, as long as it is not removed during iteration.
  - Iterators do not support parallel processing.


**Key Difference:**
- Streams are more abstract, functional, and suitable for complex processing pipelines.
- Iterators are simpler and more basic, offering manual iteration.

</details>

## Can you explain the difference between peek() and map() in Streams?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **peek():**
  - peek() is an intermediate operation used for debugging or inspecting elements of a Stream as they pass through the pipeline. It does not modify the elements in the Stream but allows you to perform an action, such as printing the element.
  - It is typically not used for altering or transforming data.

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
numbers.stream()
       .peek(n -> System.out.println("Processing: " + n))  // Used for side effects
       .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
       .collect(Collectors.toList());

```

- **map():**
  - map() is also an intermediate operation but is used for transforming each element of the Stream by applying a function. It produces a new Stream where each element is the result of applying the function.

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
List<Integer> squaredNumbers = numbers.stream()
                                      .map(n -> n * n)  // Transforms each element
                                      .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(squaredNumbers);  // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

```

</details>

## What is the difference between stream() and parallelStream()?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **stream()**
  - Processes elements sequentially in a single thread. It is the default way to process a Stream and is more suitable for small collections or when the operations are not CPU-intensive.

- **parallelStream()**
  - Processes elements in parallel using multiple threads (fork/join pool). It can be beneficial for large collections with CPU-intensive operations because it utilizes multiple cores for processing.
  - However, it has overhead associated with thread management, and parallelism is not always advantageous (especially for small collections or when the operations have side effects).

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

// Sequential Stream (single thread)
numbers.stream()
       .map(n -> n * n)
       .forEach(System.out::println);

// Parallel Stream (multiple threads)
numbers.parallelStream()
       .map(n -> n * n)
       .forEach(System.out::println);

```

## How do you handle Stream operations that may throw exceptions?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- In Streams, exceptions in lambda expressions can be problematic because Streams themselves don't directly support handling checked exceptions. 
- To handle exceptions, you can:
- **1 Wrap the operation in a try-catch block:**
  
```java
List<String> strings = Arrays.asList("1", "2", "three", "4");
List<Integer> numbers = strings.stream()
                               .map(s -> {
                                   try {
                                       return Integer.parseInt(s);
                                   } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                                       return 0;  // Default value on exception
                                   }
                               })
                               .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(numbers);  // Output: [1, 2, 0, 4]

```

- **2 Use a custom utility function to handle checked exceptions:**
  - You can create a utility method to rethrow checked exceptions as unchecked exceptions.

```java
public static <T> Function<String, T> wrapCheckedException(CheckedFunction<String, T> function) {
    return t -> {
        try {
            return function.apply(t);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    };
}

## What are the differences between count(), anyMatch(), allMatch(), and noneMatch()?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

-  These are terminal operations used to evaluate conditions on the elements of the Stream.

- **count():**
  - Returns the number of elements in the Stream.
```java
long count = Stream.of(1, 2, 3).count();  // Output: 3

```

- **anyMatch():**
  - Returns true if any element in the Stream matches the given predicate.

```java
boolean anyEven = Stream.of(1, 2, 3).anyMatch(n -> n % 2 == 0);  // Output: true

```

- **allMatch():**
  - Returns true if all elements in the Stream match the given predicate.
```java
boolean allEven = Stream.of(2, 4, 6).allMatch(n -> n % 2 == 0);  // Output: true
```

- **noneMatch():**
  - Returns true if no element in the Stream matches the given predicate.

```java
boolean noneEven = Stream.of(1, 3, 5).noneMatch(n -> n % 2 == 0);  // Output: true

```

## What is Collectors.groupingBy() and how is it used in Java Streams?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- `The Collectors.groupingBy() method is a predefined collector that groups elements of a stream by a classifier function. It returns a Map<K, List<T>> where K is the key and T is the element type. This is commonly used when you need to categorize or organize data into groups based on a property.`

Example: Grouping a list of words by their length.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class GroupingByExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> words = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry");

        // Group by word length
        Map<Integer, List<String>> groupedByLength = words.stream()
                                                           .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(String::length));
        System.out.println(groupedByLength);  // Output: {5=[apple], 6=[banana], 7=[cherry], 4=[date], 10=[elderberry]}
    }
}

```

## How does Collectors.partitioningBy() work in Java Streams?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- `The Collectors.partitioningBy() method is a special case of groupingBy() that splits the stream elements into two groups based on a predicate. It returns a Map<Boolean, List<T>>,`
- Where
  - true corresponds to elements that satisfy the predicate.
  - false corresponds to elements that do not satisfy the predicate.

Example: Partitioning a list of words based on whether their length is even or odd.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class PartitioningByExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> words = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry");

        // Partition by even or odd length
        Map<Boolean, List<String>> partitioned = words.stream()
                                                     .collect(Collectors.partitioningBy(w -> w.length() % 2 == 0));

        System.out.println(partitioned);  
        // Output: {false=[apple, banana, cherry, elderberry], true=[date]}
    }
}

```
