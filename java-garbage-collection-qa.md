## What is Garbage Collection in Java?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Garbage Collection (GC) in Java is the process of automatically identifying and reclaiming memory used by objects that are no longer reachable or needed by the program. 
- The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) performs garbage collection to ensure efficient memory management, reducing the chances of memory leaks and improving the performance of the application.

</details>

## How does Garbage Collection work in Java?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Garbage Collection works by identifying objects that are no longer referenced by any part of the program, meaning they are not accessible from any active threads. 
- The JVM uses algorithms to track object references and reclaim memory. The main steps involved in GC are:
  - **Marking:** The GC identifies all live objects in the heap (objects that are still reachable).
  - **Sweeping:** The garbage collector removes objects that are no longer reachable.
  - **Compacting:** In some GC algorithms, the heap is compacted to ensure that free memory is contiguous, which can improve allocation efficiency.

</details>

## What are the different types of Garbage Collectors in Java?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Java provides several garbage collectors (GC) based on different strategies for managing memory:
  - Serial GC: A simple, single-threaded collector suitable for applications with small heaps.
  - Parallel GC (throughput collector): Uses multiple threads for garbage collection, improving performance in multi-core systems.
  - Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) GC: A collector aimed at minimizing pause times by performing most of the work concurrently with the application.
  - G1 (Garbage First) GC: A low-latency garbage collector designed to meet specific pause-time goals while maintaining high throughput.
  - ZGC (Z Garbage Collector): A scalable, low-latency garbage collector designed for applications that require a large heap size.
  - Shenandoah GC: Another low-latency GC introduced in JDK 12, focusing on reducing pause times.

## What is a Heap in Java?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- The heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation in Java. 
- All objects in Java are created in the heap, and the garbage collector manages the allocation and reclamation of memory within this region. 
- The heap is divided into different areas:
  - Young Generation: Where new objects are allocated.
    - Eden Space: Where most new objects are initially allocated.
    - Survivor Spaces (S0 & S1): Used to hold objects that survived a GC cycle in the young generation.
  - Old Generation: Stores long-lived objects that have survived multiple GC cycles.
  - Permanent Generation (or Metaspace in newer versions): Stores class definitions, method metadata, etc.

</details>

## What is the difference between Minor GC and Major GC?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **Minor GC**
  - Minor GC: Occurs in the Young Generation when the Eden space is full and objects need to be moved to the Survivor spaces or promoted to the Old Generation. 
  - Minor GC is typically faster as it involves a smaller portion of the heap.
- **Major GC**
  - Major GC: Also known as Full GC, it occurs when the Old Generation is full and the JVM needs to reclaim space from both the Young and Old Generations. 
  - Major GC is more time-consuming and may cause significant application pause times, especially for large heaps.

</details>

## What is a "Stop-the-World" event?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- A "Stop-the-World" event occurs when the JVM halts all application threads in order to perform garbage collection. 
- During this time, the program execution is paused. 
- Both minor and major GC events can trigger Stop-the-World pauses. 
- The duration of the pause can vary depending on the type of garbage collector being used, the size of the heap, and other factors.

</details>

## What are the advantages and disadvantages of Garbage Collection?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **Advantages**
  - Automatic Memory Management: The garbage collector automatically reclaims memory, reducing the programmer's responsibility to manage memory manually.
  - Prevents Memory Leaks: By automatically cleaning up unreachable objects, GC helps avoid memory leaks.
  - Improves Efficiency: Since GC is performed in the background, it ensures efficient memory usage without manual intervention.
- **Disadvantages**
  - Performance Overhead: Garbage collection can impact application performance, especially during Stop-the-World events.
  - Unpredictable Pause Times: Some garbage collectors may introduce long pauses, which may not be acceptable for real-time applications.
  - Limited Control: Developers have limited control over the exact timing and behavior of garbage collection.

</details>

## What is the difference between the "Young Generation" and "Old Generation" in Java?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **Young Generation**:
  -  Young Generation: This area of the heap is where most of the objects are initially created. It is divided into three spaces:
    - Eden Space: Where new objects are created.
    - Survivor Spaces (S0 & S1): Where objects that survived a GC cycle in the Young Generation are moved.

Objects in the Young Generation are collected more frequently, and garbage collection in this area is faster and less expensive.

- **Old Generation:**:
  - This area stores long-lived objects that have survived multiple garbage collection cycles in the Young Generation. 
  - The objects that are promoted from the Young Generation are moved to the Old Generation. 
  - Garbage collection in this area is less frequent but more expensive.

</details>

## What is the difference between "Soft References", "Weak References", and "Phantom References" in Java?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- **Soft Reference:** An object that is softly reachable is one that is not strongly reachable but can still be garbage collected when the JVM needs memory. Soft references are used for caching.
- **Weak Reference:** An object that is weakly reachable is eligible for GC as soon as there are no strong references to it. Weak references are typically used for building mappings, like in the WeakHashMap.
- **Phantom Reference:** A phantom reference is used to schedule post-mortem cleanup after an object has been collected by GC. The object will not be accessible through the phantom reference, but it allows for finalization tasks to be triggered after an object is garbage collected.

</details>

## What is the role of the finalize() method in Java's Garbage Collection?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- The finalize() method is called by the JVM just before an object is garbage collected.
- It provides an opportunity to perform cleanup operations (e.g., releasing resources like file handles, database connections). 
- However, it is not guaranteed to be called, and it may introduce performance overhead. 
- Since finalize() is deprecated in Java 9 and later due to its unpredictability and inefficiency, it is recommended to use try-with-resources and other resource management techniques instead.

</details>

## What is the difference between the System.gc() and Runtime.gc() methods in Java?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Both System.gc() and Runtime.gc() request the JVM to perform garbage collection, but the actual GC event is not guaranteed to happen immediately. 
- The JVM may ignore the request if it determines that garbage collection is not necessary at that time.

- System.gc(): A static method of the System class that requests garbage collection.
- Runtime.gc(): A method of the Runtime class that requests garbage collection. This is equivalent to calling System.gc() but is part of the Runtime API.

In both cases, calling these methods is generally discouraged unless absolutely necessary, as it interferes with the JVM's automatic memory management.

</details>

## What are the different phases of the Garbage Collection process?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- The Garbage Collection process consists of several phases:
  - **Marking Phase:** The GC identifies all the live objects in the heap by following references from root objects.
  - **Sweeping Phase:** The GC removes all objects that are not reachable (i.e., garbage objects).
  - **Compacting Phase:** This phase compacts the memory by moving objects in the heap, which reduces fragmentation and improves allocation performance.

</details>

## What are JVM arguments used to configure heap space in Java?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- In Java, you can configure the heap space using the following JVM arguments:
  - **-Xms:** Sets the initial heap size (the amount of memory allocated to the JVM at startup). This defines how much memory the JVM should allocate initially.
  - **-Xmx:** Sets the maximum heap size (the upper limit of memory the JVM can use for the heap). It determines how large the heap can grow.

Example 

```cmd
java -Xms512m -Xmx2g MyApplication

```
Where : 
- `-Xms512m:` Sets the initial heap size to 512 MB.
- `-Xmx2g:` Sets the maximum heap size to 2 GB.

Why adjust the heap space?
- Initial Heap Size (-Xms): A higher initial heap size can reduce the overhead caused by dynamically resizing the heap during runtime.
- Maximum Heap Size (-Xmx): This should be set based on the memory requirements of the application. Setting it too high can result in the system running out of memory, while setting it too low may lead to OutOfMemoryError.

## What is the purpose of the -XX:+UseG1GC JVM argument?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- The -XX:+UseG1GC JVM argument enables the Garbage First (G1) Garbage Collector. 
- G1 is designed for applications that require both high throughput and low pause times. 
- It divides the heap into regions and prioritizes garbage collection based on the application's needs, thus aiming to meet pause-time goals.

**Use case for G1 GC:**
- When to use: It is suitable for applications with large heap sizes (e.g., multiple gigabytes of heap) and those requiring predictable low-pause times.

```cmd
java -XX:+UseG1GC MyApplication

```

G1 can also be tuned further with parameters like:
- `-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=<time>: Sets the target maximum pause time (in milliseconds).`
- `-XX:G1HeapRegionSize=<size>: Defines the region size in the heap, which can optimize G1 performance for certain workloads.`

</details>

##  What is the difference between the -XX:+UseSerialGC and -XX:+UseParallelGC JVM arguments?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- The -XX:+UseSerialGC and -XX:+UseParallelGC are JVM arguments used to specify different types of Garbage Collectors:
  - `-XX:+UseSerialGC:` This enables the Serial Garbage Collector. It uses a single thread for both minor and major garbage collections. While it's simple and has lower overhead, it can cause significant pause times and is typically used in single-threaded or small applications with limited memory.
  - For small applications, environments with limited resources, or when low memory footprint is a priority.

```shell
java -XX:+UseSerialGC MyApplication

```
- `-XX:+UseParallelGC:` This enables the Parallel Garbage Collector, which uses multiple threads to perform garbage collection tasks (such as minor garbage collection). This collector is designed to increase throughput by parallelizing the collection process in multi-core systems.
- Use case: For applications with higher memory requirements and those that need better throughput but can tolerate longer pause times.
```shell
java -XX:+UseParallelGC MyApplication

```

**Key Differences:**
- Serial GC is single-threaded, while Parallel GC uses multiple threads.
- Parallel GC is more efficient in multi-core systems and improves throughput but may introduce longer pause times.

## What factors should you consider when choosing a garbage collector for your application?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

When choosing a garbage collector for your Java application, the following factors should be considered:

- Pause Time Requirements:
  - Low Latency: If your application requires low pause times (e.g., real-time applications), you should consider garbage collectors like G1 GC, ZGC, or Shenandoah GC.
  - High Throughput: If your application can tolerate longer pauses but needs high throughput, consider Parallel GC.
- Heap Size:
  - For large heaps (e.g., 10 GB or more), G1 GC, ZGC, or Shenandoah GC are more efficient.
  - For smaller heaps, Serial GC or Parallel GC may suffice.
- Application Behavior:
  - If your application performs long-running background tasks or uses large datasets (e.g., batch processing), Parallel GC might be a good choice.
  - For applications that need consistent low-latency performance (e.g., web servers), G1, ZGC, or Shenandoah GC would be better suited.
- System Resources:
  - Parallel GC is ideal for multi-core systems, as it can take advantage of multiple CPU threads for garbage collection tasks.
  - Serial GC is useful in environments with limited resources or single-core processors.
